# Git Basics

* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - I can use this anytime to see the current status of the repository
* `git add <file>` - places the file in the git staging area
* `git commit -m` - commits files to the repository 
* `git diff` - shows differences between an edited file and the commited file?
* `git log` - gives you the log of commits in your repository

* `git remote add origin https://github.com/jensmuehle/learning-git.git`
* `git remote -v` - check status of remote repositories
* `git push -u origin master` - push local file to remote repository
* `git pull origin master` - pull any changes from remote repository to local repository

* `Forking a repository` - (on github) create a complete copy of an existing Github repository to enable collaboration (or stealing)
* `git clone https://github.com/jensmuehle/learning-git-1.git` - (in a new directory) clone the remote repository (which is a fork you made from another repository)
